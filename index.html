        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think, learn, and adapt like humans. It encompasses various technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision, enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is transforming industries, driving innovation, and reshaping the future of work, healthcare, entertainment, and much more. From virtual assistants like me to advanced autonomous systems, AI continues to push the boundaries of what's possible.
            Whether you're exploring AI for the first time or diving deeper into its applications, you're part of an exciting journey into the future of technology!

        <h2 id="hist">History of AI</h2>
        <p>AI began in the 1950s with pioneers like Alan Turing, who proposed the "Turing Test." The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference. Early AI focused on problem-solving and symbolic reasoning but faced limitations due to weak computational power.
            In the 1980s, expert systems gained popularity by simulating human decision-making. AI made headlines in 1997 when IBM's Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
            The 2010s brought breakthroughs in machine learning and deep learning, leading to advanced applications like autonomous vehicles and AI-powered assistants. Today, AI is rapidly advancing across industries, driving innovation and transforming society.

        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) works by learning from data, mimicking human intelligence through advanced algorithms. The process starts with feeding large amounts of data into AI systems, which then analyze this data to recognize patterns and make decisions. AI models are trained using this data, with some methods using labeled data (supervised learning) and others allowing the AI to find patterns on its own (unsupervised learning). Once trained, the AI can apply its knowledge to new data, making predictions or decisions. Over time, as the AI processes more information, it becomes more accurate and effective at tasks, from language translation to autonomous driving.
